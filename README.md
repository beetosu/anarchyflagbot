# anarchyflagbot
A Twitter bot that creates a bisected anarchist flag with a random color, pairs it a random word ending with "ism", and tweets it as a new school of leftist thought.

It's currently online!

# FAQ:
## Q: Why?
I dunno, thought it was funny.

## Q: How long will this be active?
When it runs out of words/flag colors, which will be ~1 month from it's initial deployment.

## Q: Hey! This color is the exact same as [actual political ideology]!
I attempted to strike a balance between being a different enough color from any actual ideology or previously made flag, and having enough colors to actually have this bot active for longer than a couple days. As such, it may look like colors are repeating or using pre-established colors, but it *technically* isn't.

## Q: The bot tweeted anarcho-[word], which is a real thing!
I *think* I wrote down every obviously established idology ("communism", "capitalism", "mutualism", etc.) down in the prohibited words list, but it's entirely possible I missed one. Feel free to let me know if this happens, so I can correct it.
