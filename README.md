it's currently live @anarchyflagbot

# FAQ:
## Q: Why?
I dunno, thought it was funny.

## Q: How long will this be active?
When it runs out of words/flag colors, which will be ~1 month from it's initial deployment.

## Q: Hey! This color is the exact same as [actual political ideology]!
I attempted to strike a balance between being a different enough color from any actual ideology or previously made flag, and having enough colors to actually have this bot active for longer than a couple days. As such, it may look like colors are repeating or using pre-established colors, but it *technically* isn't.
